## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing methods for morphological profiling.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AWK, Gaussian Processes and many new tools and methods :).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on isolating CellProfiler features to become their own skimage-compatible package.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with interpretability of deep learning models in biology.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about yeast cells and why they are so cool and underrated!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am building a personal cookbook solely in org-mode.
