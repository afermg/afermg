## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing ML and DL methods for novel insights in bioimaging.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AWK, Gaussian Processes and sensible integration of LLMs into my workflows.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with interpretability of deep learning models in biology and biochemistry.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about lambda calculus and S-expressions and why they are so cool!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am building a personal cookbook solely in org-mode.
